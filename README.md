# 🤖 Master AI Co-Partner (Python)

**Master AI Co-Partner** is a personal, offline-first AI system built in Python and designed as a true *co-partner* — not just a chatbot.

This project blends:
- Local AI thinking
- Long-term memory
- Voice input & voice output
- Event-driven logic
- Modular security & control

It is being built through active collaboration between:
> A human builder + an AI co-designer

This is a living system. It grows as we learn.

## 🧭 Purpose

This AI is being designed to:
- Assist in daily life, gaming, streaming, and development
- Talk and listen naturally
- Remember past interactions locally
- Help manage memory, focus, and workflow
- Eventually see the screen and interact with software
- Stay **private, offline-capable, and user-controlled**

This is **not a corporate assistant**.  
This is a **personal co-partner**.

## ✅ Current Working Systems

- ✅ Core AI engine (local + optional networked)
- ✅ Event bus
- ✅ Modular memory (short-term + long-term)
- ✅ Command system
- ✅ Local Text-To-Speech (AI speaks aloud)
- ✅ Local microphone recording
- ✅ GitHub version control & rollback safety

- 🔜 Voice hotkey control (F12 start/stop listening)
- 🔜 Screen vision & window awareness
- 🔜 Discord / Twitch integration
- 🔜 Multi-device networked thinking
- 🔜 Physical hardware controls (servo/treat system)
